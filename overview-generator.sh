===============================================================

## Project Purpose and Architecture

This is a distributed cooperative network system (ICN) with a blockchain-based architecture implementing a cooperative governance model. The system is designed to facilitate trustless cooperation between network participants.

## Key Components

### Core Components
- **Backend**: Rust-based node implementation handling consensus, blockchain, and network operations
- **Frontend**: TypeScript/React web interface for user interaction
- **Contracts**: Smart contracts for cooperative governance and rule enforcement

### Service Layers
1. **Blockchain Layer**: Handles state management and consensus
2. **Identity Layer**: DID-based identity management for network participants
3. **Relationship Layer**: Tracks interactions and relationships between members
4. **Reputation Layer**: Manages trust and reputation scores in the network
5. **Governance Layer**: Handles proposals, voting, and rule enforcement
6. **Communication Layer**: WebSocket and P2P communication between nodes

## Directory Structure

- **/backend/**: Core Rust implementation of the node software
  - **/src/**: Source code for the backend
    - **/api/**: API endpoints and handlers
    - **/services/**: Core services implementation
    - **/network/**: Network communication code
    - **/blockchain/**: Blockchain implementation

- **/frontend/**: React-based web interface
  - **/src/**: TypeScript source code
    - **/components/**: UI components
    - **/services/**: Frontend services for API communication

- **/contracts/**: Smart contract implementations
  - Various contract modules with their own src directories

- **/src/**: Core shared codebase
  - **/api/**: API definitions
  - **/consensus/**: Consensus mechanism implementation
  - **/governance/**: Governance rules and voting mechanisms
  - **/identity/**: Identity management
  - **/dsl/**: Domain-specific language for governance rules
  - **/services/**: Shared services
  - **/storage/**: Data storage implementations

- **/identity/**, **/reputation/**, **/governance/**, etc.: Specialized modules for each system layer

## Key Technologies

- **Rust**: Primary backend language
- **TypeScript/React**: Frontend stack
- **Blockchain**: Custom implementation for consensus and state
- **WebSocket**: Real-time communication
- **Smart Contracts**: For governance and rule enforcement
- **DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers)**: For identity management

## Data Flow

1. Users interact with the system through the frontend
2. API requests are processed by backend handlers
3. Blockchain operations follow consensus rules
4. Identity and reputation scores affect governance decisions
5. Smart contracts enforce rules and handle automated processes
6. Events are propagated through the network via WebSocket/P2P

## Important Files

- **src/main.rs**: Entry point for the backend application
- **src/lib.rs**: Core library exports
- **backend/src/api/routes.rs**: API endpoint definitions
- **frontend/src/index.ts**: Frontend entry point
- **src/consensus/mod.rs**: Consensus implementation
- **src/governance/mod.rs**: Governance rules
- **src/dsl/**: Domain-specific language for rules
- **docker-compose.yml**: Container orchestration

## Dependencies and Requirements

The project relies on various Rust crates and NPM packages, with core dependencies being:
- Rust blockchain and cryptography libraries
- React and TypeScript for frontend
- WebSocket libraries for communication
- Database connectors for storage

## Build and Deployment

The system can be deployed as:
- Individual nodes in a distributed network
- Docker containers orchestrated with docker-compose
- Development setup with local components

## Notes for Analysis

When reviewing the code:
1. Focus on interaction between layers (identity, reputation, governance)
2. Pay attention to consensus mechanisms and validation rules
3. Understand the governance DSL and rule enforcement
4. Note how reputation scores influence system behavior
