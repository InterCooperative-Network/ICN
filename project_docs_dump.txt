# Transaction Lifecycle System

## Overview
The Transaction Lifecycle System provides a secure, traceable, and immutable process for handling all cooperative transactions within the ICN. This document details the lifecycle of a transaction, from initiation and validation to finalization and storage in the blockchain. The system is designed to ensure consistency, security, and transparency in all cooperative actions.

### Purpose
- **Immutability**: Maintain a secure and unalterable record of all transactions.
- **Traceability**: Allow cooperatives to track resource allocation, proposal voting, and other actions.
- **Accountability**: Ensure all actions align with ICN's governance standards through DID and reputation validation.

### Components Involved
- **Blockchain Module**: Manages the chain of blocks where transactions are stored.
- **DID System**: Verifies the identities of transaction participants.
- **Reputation System**: Validates that users have the necessary reputation to execute actions.

---

## 1. Transaction Lifecycle

### 1.1 Transaction Initiation

1. **Process**:
   - A transaction is created with the following attributes: `sender`, `receiver`, `amount`, `timestamp`, and `purpose`.
   - A unique transaction hash is generated using `SHA-256` to prevent duplicates.

2. **Validation**:
   - The transaction undergoes an initial validation to confirm that the `sender` has a valid DID and that the specified `amount` respects the cooperative’s resource allocation limits.

3. **Attributes**:
   - **Sender**: The DID of the transaction initiator.
   - **Receiver**: The DID of the transaction recipient.
   - **Amount**: The value/resource quantity being transferred.
   - **Timestamp**: Millisecond timestamp of transaction initiation.
   - **Purpose**: A brief description of the transaction’s intent.

### 1.2 Transaction Validation

1. **DID Verification**:
   - Ensure that both the `sender` and `receiver` have valid DIDs. Invalid or nonexistent DIDs will cause the transaction to fail validation.
   
2. **Reputation Check**:
   - Confirm that the `sender` meets any minimum reputation thresholds required by the transaction type.
   - If the reputation requirement is not met, the transaction is rejected with an error.

3. **Signature Verification**:
   - The transaction must be signed by the `sender`’s key, verified using ECC (secp256k1) or, when specified, quantum-resistant keys (CRYSTALS-Dilithium).
   
4. **Timestamp Verification**:
   - Check that the `timestamp` is valid and aligns with recent blockchain activity to prevent replay attacks.

### 1.3 Transaction Processing

1. **Hashing**:
   - Calculate a unique hash for the transaction, incorporating attributes like `sender`, `receiver`, `amount`, and `timestamp`.
   
2. **Pending Pool**:
   - Place the validated transaction in the pending transactions pool until a new block is finalized.

### 1.4 Block Finalization

1. **Block Creation**:
   - At defined intervals or upon reaching a set number of transactions, pending transactions are bundled into a new block.
   
2. **Block Hashing**:
   - A hash of the new block is computed, linking it to the previous block for chain integrity.
   
3. **Chain Update**:
   - The finalized block is added to the blockchain, and the pending transactions pool is cleared.

## 2. Data Structures

### 2.1 Transaction Object

```rust
Transaction {
    sender: String,
    receiver: String,
    amount: u64,
    timestamp: u128,
    hash: String,
}

# Identity System Specification

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

The Identity System is responsible for managing Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) within the Inter-Cooperative Network (ICN). It ensures secure authentication and authorization for users, cooperatives, and nodes by leveraging cryptographic key pairs. The system supports both Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) and quantum-resistant algorithms to future-proof security.

### 1.2 Core Components

- **DID Management**: Creation, retrieval, and update of DIDs.
- **Authentication Service**: Verifies identities through cryptographic signatures.
- **Authorization Mechanism**: Controls access to resources based on roles and permissions.

## 2. Detailed Specifications

### 2.1 Data Structures

#### 2.1.1 DID Document

```json
{
  "id": "did:icn:unique_identifier",
  "publicKey": "base64_encoded_public_key",
  "authentication": "authentication_method",
  "created": "timestamp",
  "updated": "timestamp"
}
```

- **id**: Unique identifier following the `did:icn:` namespace.
- **publicKey**: The public key associated with the DID, encoded in base64.
- **authentication**: Method used for verifying the DID owner.
- **created**: Timestamp of when the DID was created.
- **updated**: Timestamp of the last update to the DID document.

### 2.2 Interfaces

#### 2.2.1 API Endpoints

##### Create DID

- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/identity/did`
- **Description**: Registers a new DID in the network.
- **Request Body**:

  ```json
  {
    "publicKey": "base64_encoded_public_key"
  }
  ```

- **Response**:

  ```json
  {
    "did": "did:icn:unique_identifier"
  }
  ```

##### Resolve DID

- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/identity/did/{did}`
- **Description**: Retrieves the DID document for the specified DID.
- **Response**:

  ```json
  {
    "didDocument": {
      "id": "did:icn:unique_identifier",
      "publicKey": "base64_encoded_public_key",
      "authentication": "authentication_method",
      "created": "timestamp",
      "updated": "timestamp"
    }
  }
  ```

##### Authenticate

- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/identity/authenticate`
- **Description**: Verifies the identity and issues an authentication token.
- **Request Body**:

  ```json
  {
    "did": "did:icn:unique_identifier",
    "signature": "base64_encoded_signature",
    "nonce": "server_provided_nonce"
  }
  ```

- **Response**:

  ```json
  {
    "token": "jwt_token"
  }
  ```

### 2.3 Behaviors

#### 2.3.1 DID Creation Workflow

1. **Key Generation**: The user generates a key pair locally, choosing between ECC or quantum-resistant algorithms.
2. **Public Key Submission**: The user sends the public key to the Identity System via the `Create DID` endpoint.
3. **DID Registration**: The system creates a unique DID, stores the DID document, and returns the DID to the user.

#### 2.3.2 Authentication Workflow

1. **Nonce Request**: The user requests a nonce from the server to prevent replay attacks.
2. **Signature Generation**: The user signs the nonce with their private key.
3. **Authentication Request**: The user sends the DID, signature, and nonce to the server.
4. **Verification**: The server verifies the signature using the public key from the DID document.
5. **Token Issuance**: Upon successful verification, the server issues a JWT token for authenticated sessions.

## 3. Implementation Guidelines

### 3.1 Performance Requirements

- **Scalability**: The system should handle a large number of DID registrations and authentication requests concurrently.
- **Low Latency**: Authentication and DID resolution should occur with minimal delay to ensure a smooth user experience.

### 3.2 Security Requirements

- **Key Security**: Users must securely store their private keys; the system should never have access to private keys.
- **Replay Attack Prevention**: Use nonces or timestamps during authentication to prevent replay attacks.
- **Quantum Resistance**: Support for quantum-resistant algorithms like CRYSTALS-Dilithium and CRYSTALS-Kyber should be implemented to future-proof the system.

### 3.3 Error Handling

- **Detailed Error Messages**: Provide clear and actionable error messages without revealing sensitive information.
- **Failure Modes**: Gracefully handle failures in DID creation, resolution, and authentication.

## 4. Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests**: Cover all functions related to DID management and authentication.
- **Integration Tests**: Test the interaction between the Identity System and other modules like the Reputation System and Governance Module.
- **Security Tests**: Perform vulnerability assessments and penetration testing to ensure robust security measures are in place.

## 5. Monitoring and Metrics

- **Audit Logs**: Maintain logs for DID creation, updates, and authentication attempts for auditing purposes.
- **Performance Metrics**: Monitor response times for API endpoints and system load.
- **Security Alerts**: Implement alerts for suspicious activities, such as repeated failed authentication attempts.

## 6. Future Considerations

- **DID Deactivation**: Provide a mechanism for users to deactivate or revoke their DIDs in case of key compromise.
- **Metadata Integration**: Include optional metadata in DID documents, such as reputation scores and cooperative affiliations.
- **Cross-Network Compatibility**: Ensure the Identity System is compatible with other decentralized networks for broader interoperability.

# Proof of Cooperation (PoC) Consensus Mechanism

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

The Proof of Cooperation (PoC) is a consensus mechanism designed specifically for the Inter-Cooperative Network (ICN) to facilitate secure, efficient, and cooperative blockchain operations. Unlike traditional consensus mechanisms such as Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS), PoC emphasizes collaboration, democratic participation, and reputation-based accountability to align with cooperative principles.

### 1.2 Core Principles

- **Democratic Participation**: Ensures inclusive decision-making by allowing each node, representing a cooperative or individual within ICN, to contribute to consensus.
- **Incentivized Cooperation**: Rewards are based on positive contributions to the cooperative ecosystem rather than computational power or wealth.
- **Reputation-Driven Accountability**: Reputation scores influence participation and voting power, holding nodes accountable to ethical standards.
- **Environmental Sustainability**: Eliminates energy-intensive computations, maintaining an energy-efficient model.

## 2. Detailed Specifications

### 2.1 System Components

#### 2.1.1 Node Types and Roles

- **Validator Nodes**: Nodes that meet certain cooperative engagement criteria (e.g., reputation threshold) and participate in validating transactions and blocks.
- **Observer Nodes**: Nodes that maintain a copy of the blockchain for transparency and auditing but do not participate in validation.
- **Coordinator Node**: A validator node selected per consensus round to organize and propose blocks. Selection is based on a weighted lottery tied to reputation scores.

#### 2.1.2 Reputation System Integration

- **Reputation-Weighted Voting**: Nodes with higher reputation have slightly increased influence in the consensus process, capped to prevent centralization.
- **Dynamic Recalibration**: Reputation scores adjust based on ongoing contributions and decay over time to encourage continuous engagement.

### 2.2 Consensus Process

#### 2.2.1 Transaction Verification

1. **Submission**: Nodes submit transactions to the network.
2. **Preliminary Checks**: The Coordinator Node performs initial validation of transactions.
3. **Broadcast**: Validated transactions are broadcasted to Validator Nodes for multi-signature approval.

#### 2.2.2 Voting Round Execution

1. **Block Proposal**: The Coordinator Node assembles a candidate block with selected transactions.
2. **Reputation-Weighted Voting**:
   - Each Validator Node votes on the proposed block.
   - Votes are weighted based on reputation scores.
   - Voting power is capped to prevent undue influence.
3. **Consensus Threshold**: A supermajority (e.g., 66%) of weighted votes is required for block approval.

#### 2.2.3 Block Finalization

1. **Multi-Signature Collection**: Validator Nodes sign the approved block.
2. **Block Addition**: The signed block is added to the blockchain and propagated to the network.
3. **Reputation Adjustment**: Validators gain reputation for participation or lose reputation for misconduct.

### 2.3 Security Mechanisms

#### 2.3.1 Cryptographic Security

- **Asymmetric Encryption**: Utilizes public/private key pairs for secure communication and transaction signing.
- **Digital Signatures**: Ensures authenticity and non-repudiation of transactions and blocks.
- **Hash Functions**: Employs secure hash algorithms for data integrity.

#### 2.3.2 Sybil Attack Prevention

- **Reputation Requirements**: High reputation thresholds for Validator Nodes make it difficult for malicious actors to gain influence.
- **Identity Verification**: DIDs are tied to real-world cooperative entities, adding authenticity.

#### 2.3.3 Byzantine Fault Tolerance

- **Consensus Thresholds**: Requires a supermajority for block approval, tolerating up to one-third faulty or malicious nodes.
- **Multi-Signature Validation**: Collective block signing prevents unilateral block creation.

#### 2.3.4 Double-Spending Prevention

- **Transaction Finality**: Once confirmed, transactions are immutable.
- **Sequential Ordering**: Transactions are time-stamped and ordered to prevent conflicts.

#### 2.3.5 Integrity Audits and Penalties

- **Automated Audits**: Regular checks ensure protocol compliance.
- **Reputation Penalties**: Misconduct results in reputation loss.
- **Node Exclusion**: Severe violations can lead to temporary or permanent removal.

#### 2.3.6 Quantum-Resistant Cryptography

- **Post-Quantum Algorithms**: Implements CRYSTALS-Kyber and CRYSTALS-Dilithium for future-proof security.

### 2.4 Blockchain Components

#### 2.4.1 Block Structure

- **Block Header**:
  - **Previous Block Hash**: Links the block to the chain.
  - **Merkle Root**: Summarizes all transactions.
  - **Timestamp**: Time of block creation.
  - **Coordinator Signature**: Validates the Coordinator Node's role.
- **Block Body**:
  - **Transactions**: List of validated transactions.
  - **Validator Signatures**: Multi-signatures from Validator Nodes.

#### 2.4.2 Transactions

- **Standard Transactions**: Asset transfers between participants.
- **Governance Transactions**: Proposals and votes for network changes.
- **Metadata**: Additional information for transparency.

#### 2.4.3 State Management

- **State Database**: Maintains current account states.
- **State Transitions**: Defined by executed transactions.

### 2.5 Efficiency Considerations

#### 2.5.1 Consensus Efficiency

- **Lightweight Process**: Eliminates energy-intensive computations.
- **Fast Finality**: Quick transaction confirmation due to cooperative agreement.

#### 2.5.2 Scalability Solutions

- **Sharding**: Divides the network into smaller groups process 
#### 2.5.3 Resource Optimization

- **Minimal Hardware Requirements**: Encourages broader participation.
- **Bandwidth Management**: Efficient protocols reduce network load.

## 3. Implementation Guidelines

### 3.1 Performance Requirements

- **Transaction Throughput**: Optimize for high throughput suitable for network demands.
- **Latency Minimization**: Ensure minimal delay in consensus rounds.

### 3.2 Security Requirements

- **Immutable Ledger**: Blocks are immutable once added.
- **Access Control**: Only authorized nodes can validate and propose blocks.
- **Data Integrity**: Secure cryptographic practices ensure data integrity.

### 3.3 Error Handling

- **Invalid Transactions**: Provide clear error messages upon rejection.
- **Fork Handling**: Establish protocols for resolving chain forks.

## 4. Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests**: Cover consensus mechanisms, transaction validation, and security features.
- **Integration Tests**: Test interactions with other systems like the Identity and Reputation Systems.
- **Stress Tests**: Simulate high network load to test scalability.

## 5. Monitoring and Metrics
