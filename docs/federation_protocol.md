# Federation Protocol

## Introduction
This document outlines the federation protocol for how multiple co-ops or chains handshake, exchange states, and resolve conflicts.

## Synchronization Patterns
- **Node Resync**: Describe the process for nodes to resync after downtime, including steps and protocols used.

## Handling Conflicts
- **Conflict Resolution**: Define the rules and mechanisms for resolving conflicts when multiple co-ops propose contradictory resource transactions.
- **Canonical Chain**: Specify which chain is considered canonical in case of conflicts.

## Data Exchange
- **State Exchange**: Outline the process for exchanging states between co-ops or chains.
- **Handshake Protocol**: Detail the handshake protocol for establishing connections between nodes.

## Security Considerations
- **Authentication**: Describe the authentication mechanisms used to ensure secure communication between nodes.
- **Data Integrity**: Explain how data integrity is maintained during exchanges.
