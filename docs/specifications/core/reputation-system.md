# Reputation System Documentation

## Overview

The Reputation System is a foundational component of the Inter-Cooperative Network (ICN). It is designed to track and quantify the contributions of individuals and entities, thereby providing a dynamic reputation score. This score influences governance participation, resource access, and eligibility for cooperative activities, ensuring that stakeholders are held accountable and incentivized to act in ways that benefit the community.

### Purpose
- **Trust Mechanism**: Establish a measurable trust mechanism to distinguish reliable contributors from malicious actors.
- **Incentive Alignment**: Encourage positive behavior by rewarding constructive contributions with reputation points.
- **Access Control**: Gate access to certain activities or permissions based on reputation to ensure only trustworthy actors participate in critical governance processes.

## 1. System Components

### 1.1 Reputation Score
A reputation score is an integer value associated with each Decentralized Identifier (DID). It fluctuates based on an entityâ€™s actions, contributions, and compliance with community standards.

#### Reputation Score Attributes
- **Initial Score**: New participants start with a baseline reputation score, typically set to 0.
- **Dynamic Adjustment**: The reputation score changes in response to specific actions, which can be positive (increasing reputation) or negative (decreasing reputation).
- **Decay Rate**: Reputation decays over time if there are no recent contributions, ensuring ongoing community engagement.

### 1.2 Reputation Ledger
The Reputation Ledger maintains an immutable history of all reputation changes associated with each DID.

#### Ledger Structure
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct ReputationLedger {
    pub changes: Vec<ReputationChange>,
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct ReputationChange {
    pub did: String,
    pub change: i32,
    pub reason: String,
    pub timestamp: u64,
}
```
- **changes**: A list of reputation changes, including increase or decrease values, reasons, and timestamps.

## 2. Key Methods

### 2.1 Adjusting Reputation
Reputation can be adjusted for various actions, such as contributions to governance, resource sharing, or verified claims.

#### Modify Reputation
```rust
pub fn modify_reputation(&mut self, did: &str, change: i32, reason: String) {
    let entry = ReputationChange {
        did: did.to_string(),
        change,
        reason,
        timestamp: current_timestamp(),
    };
    self.changes.push(entry);
}
```
- **Input**: `did` (identifier of the entity), `change` (positive or negative reputation adjustment), `reason` (description).
- **Functionality**: Adds a reputation change entry to the ledger.

### 2.2 Fetching Reputation Score
This method returns the current reputation score for a given DID by summing the changes recorded in the ledger.

#### Get Reputation Score
```rust
pub fn get_reputation_score(&self, did: &str) -> i32 {
    self.changes.iter().filter(|c| c.did == did).map(|c| c.change).sum()
}
```
- **Input**: `did` (identifier of the entity).
- **Output**: An integer representing the current reputation score.

### 2.3 Verifying Eligibility for Operations
Some operations, such as proposing actions or joining federations, require a minimum reputation score. This method verifies eligibility.

#### Check Reputation Eligibility
```rust
pub fn is_eligible(&self, did: &str, min_reputation: i32) -> bool {
    self.get_reputation_score(did) >= min_reputation
}
```
- **Input**: `did` (identifier of the entity), `min_reputation` (minimum required reputation score).
- **Output**: Boolean indicating whether the entity is eligible.

## 3. Reputation Adjustments

### 3.1 Positive Contributions
Entities can gain reputation through activities that benefit the cooperative network.

- **Governance Participation**: Voting or contributing to governance decisions.
- **Resource Sharing**: Providing resources to other members or federations.
- **Verified Claims**: Making verifiable claims that are validated by peers.

### 3.2 Negative Adjustments
Reputation can be reduced for behaviors that harm the network or violate cooperative policies.

- **Misconduct**: Behaviors that undermine trust, such as spamming or dishonesty.
- **Resource Misuse**: Wasting shared resources or failing to comply with resource-sharing policies.
- **Failed Proposals**: Proposing actions repeatedly that are rejected by the community due to poor alignment with cooperative values.

### 3.3 Reputation Decay
If entities are inactive for prolonged periods, their reputation decays to encourage continuous participation.

- **Decay Function**: The decay rate is applied periodically (e.g., monthly) to reduce scores by a small percentage if no positive actions are recorded.

## 4. Security Considerations

### 4.1 Reputation Manipulation Prevention
- **Collusion Resistance**: To prevent users from inflating reputation scores through collusion, only verified actions (e.g., resource contributions and governance participation) impact the score.
- **Threshold Limitations**: Reputation changes have thresholds to avoid extreme adjustments from single actions.

### 4.2 Transparency and Accountability
- **Immutable Ledger**: The Reputation Ledger is immutable, ensuring that all reputation adjustments are recorded transparently and cannot be altered after the fact.
- **Public Visibility**: Reputation scores and their historical adjustments are accessible to network participants for transparency, promoting accountability.

## 5. Implementation Guidelines

### 5.1 Performance Considerations
- **Efficient Ledger Access**: Use indexed data structures to enable efficient lookup and aggregation of reputation changes for each DID.
- **Scalable Design**: The system should support hundreds of thousands of reputation entries, ensuring smooth functioning even as the network scales.

### 5.2 Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: Include tests for key methods such as `modify_reputation`, `get_reputation_score`, and `is_eligible`.
- **Scenario-Based Testing**: Develop test scenarios for different participant behaviors, including positive and negative reputation changes, and ensure the system behaves as expected.

## 6. Future Considerations

### 6.1 Integration with Governance and Voting
Integrate reputation with voting weights, enabling participants with higher reputation scores to have more influence over non-critical decisions, while maintaining democratic equality for essential decisions.

### 6.2 Multi-Dimensional Reputation
Develop a multi-dimensional reputation system that allows different reputation categories (e.g., governance, resource sharing, technical contributions) to be tracked independently, providing a more nuanced view of each participant's contributions.

## Appendix

### A. Summary of Reputation Methods
- **Modify Reputation**: Adjusts the reputation score for a given entity, adding a new entry to the ledger.
- **Get Reputation Score**: Retrieves the current reputation score for a DID.
- **Check Eligibility**: Verifies if an entity meets the minimum reputation required for a given operation.
