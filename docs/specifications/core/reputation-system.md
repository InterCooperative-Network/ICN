# Reputation System Documentation

## Overview

The Reputation System is a foundational component of the Inter-Cooperative Network (ICN). It is designed to track and quantify the contributions of individuals and entities, thereby providing a dynamic reputation score. This score influences governance participation, resource access, and eligibility for cooperative activities, ensuring that stakeholders are held accountable and incentivized to act in ways that benefit the community.

### Purpose
- **Trust Mechanism**: Establish a measurable trust mechanism to distinguish reliable contributors from malicious actors.
- **Incentive Alignment**: Encourage positive behavior by rewarding constructive contributions with reputation points.
- **Access Control**: Gate access to certain activities or permissions based on reputation to ensure only trustworthy actors participate in critical governance processes.

## 1. System Components

### 1.1 Reputation Score
A reputation score is an integer value associated with each Decentralized Identifier (DID). It fluctuates based on an entityâ€™s actions, contributions, and compliance with community standards.

#### Reputation Score Attributes
- **Initial Score**: New participants start with a baseline reputation score, typically set to 0.
- **Dynamic Adjustment**: The reputation score changes in response to specific actions, which can be positive (increasing reputation) or negative (decreasing reputation).
- **Decay Rate**: Reputation decays over time if there are no recent contributions, ensuring ongoing community engagement.

### 1.2 Reputation Ledger
The Reputation Ledger maintains an immutable history of all reputation changes associated with each DID.

#### Ledger Structure
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct ReputationLedger {
    pub changes: Vec<ReputationChange>,
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct ReputationChange {
    pub did: String,
    pub change: i32,
    pub reason: String,
    pub timestamp: u64,
}
```
- **changes**: A list of reputation changes, including increase or decrease values, reasons, and timestamps.

### 1.3 Multi-Dimensional Reputation
The system supports multi-dimensional reputation tracking, allowing different types of contributions to be tracked independently.

#### Reputation Categories
- **Governance**: Contributions to governance activities.
- **Resource Sharing**: Contributions to resource sharing.
- **Technical Contributions**: Contributions to technical development and support.

## 2. Key Methods

### 2.1 Adjusting Reputation
Reputation can be adjusted for various actions, such as contributions to governance, resource sharing, or verified claims.

#### Modify Reputation
```rust
pub fn modify_reputation(&mut self, did: &str, change: i32, reason: String, category: String) {
    let entry = ReputationChange {
        did: did.to_string(),
        change,
        reason,
        timestamp: current_timestamp(),
        category,
    };
    self.changes.push(entry);
}
```
- **Input**: `did` (identifier of the entity), `change` (positive or negative reputation adjustment), `reason` (description), `category` (reputation category).
- **Functionality**: Adds a reputation change entry to the ledger.

### 2.2 Fetching Reputation Score
This method returns the current reputation score for a given DID by summing the changes recorded in the ledger.

#### Get Reputation Score
```rust
pub fn get_reputation_score(&self, did: &str, category: &str) -> i32 {
    self.changes.iter().filter(|c| c.did == did && c.category == category).map(|c| c.change).sum()
}
```
- **Input**: `did` (identifier of the entity), `category` (reputation category).
- **Output**: An integer representing the current reputation score for the specified category.

### 2.3 Verifying Eligibility for Operations
Some operations, such as proposing actions or joining federations, require a minimum reputation score. This method verifies eligibility.

#### Check Reputation Eligibility
```rust
pub fn is_eligible(&self, did: &str, min_reputation: i32, category: &str) -> bool {
    self.get_reputation_score(did, category) >= min_reputation
}
```
- **Input**: `did` (identifier of the entity), `min_reputation` (minimum required reputation score), `category` (reputation category).
- **Output**: Boolean indicating whether the entity is eligible.

## 3. Reputation Adjustments

### 3.1 Positive Contributions
Entities can gain reputation through activities that benefit the cooperative network.

- **Governance Participation**: Voting or contributing to governance decisions.
- **Resource Sharing**: Providing resources to other members or federations.
- **Verified Claims**: Making verifiable claims that are validated by peers.

### 3.2 Negative Adjustments
Reputation can be reduced for behaviors that harm the network or violate cooperative policies.

- **Misconduct**: Behaviors that undermine trust, such as spamming or dishonesty.
- **Resource Misuse**: Wasting shared resources or failing to comply with resource-sharing policies.
- **Failed Proposals**: Proposing actions repeatedly that are rejected by the community due to poor alignment with cooperative values.

### 3.3 Reputation Decay
If entities are inactive for prolonged periods, their reputation decays to encourage continuous participation.

- **Decay Function**: The decay rate is applied periodically (e.g., monthly) to reduce scores by a small percentage if no positive actions are recorded.
- **Decay Rate Configuration**: The decay rate can be configured to adapt to different community dynamics and participation levels.
- **Decay Exemptions**: Certain participants or activities can be exempted from decay to ensure critical contributors are not unfairly penalized for temporary inactivity.

## 4. Security Considerations

### 4.1 Reputation Manipulation Prevention
- **Collusion Resistance**: To prevent users from inflating reputation scores through collusion, only verified actions (e.g., resource contributions and governance participation) impact the score.
- **Threshold Limitations**: Reputation changes have thresholds to avoid extreme adjustments from single actions.

### 4.2 Transparency and Accountability
- **Immutable Ledger**: The Reputation Ledger is immutable, ensuring that all reputation adjustments are recorded transparently and cannot be altered after the fact.
- **Public Visibility**: Reputation scores and their historical adjustments are accessible to network participants for transparency, promoting accountability.
- **Public Reputation Ledger**: The reputation ledger is publicly accessible, allowing participants to view the history of reputation changes for each DID.
- **Detailed Change Logs**: Detailed logs for each reputation change include the reason, timestamp, and the entity responsible for the adjustment.
- **Reputation Dashboards**: Dashboards display reputation scores and changes, providing participants with a clear and transparent view of their reputation status and history.

### 4.3 Reputation Decay
A decay mechanism is introduced that gradually reduces reputation scores over time if participants do not engage in positive activities. This encourages continuous participation and prevents reputation scores from remaining static.

### 4.4 Reputation-Based Access Control
Permissions are checked against reputation thresholds to ensure that only participants with sufficient reputation can perform critical actions. This is managed by the `IdentitySystem` in `identity/identity_system.rs`.

### 4.5 Reputation-Weighted Voting
In the Proof of Cooperation consensus mechanism, voting power is influenced by the reputation scores of the participants. This ensures that participants with higher reputation scores have a greater impact on the decision-making process, while maintaining a cap to prevent centralization.

### 4.6 Real-Time Reputation Recalibration
Real-time reputation recalibration is implemented to ensure that reputation scores are continuously updated based on ongoing activities and contributions. This includes:

- **Continuous Monitoring**: The reputation system is integrated with various components of the network, such as the consensus mechanism, governance, and resource sharing, to continuously monitor the activities and contributions of participants.
- **Periodic Updates**: Periodic updates are scheduled to recalculate reputation scores based on recent activities and contributions. This is done using a background task or a scheduled job that runs at regular intervals.
- **Event-Driven Recalibration**: An event-driven system is implemented that recalibrates reputation scores in response to specific events, such as successful block proposals, voting participation, or resource sharing.
- **Decay Mechanism**: A decay mechanism is introduced that gradually reduces reputation scores over time if participants do not engage in positive activities. This encourages continuous participation and prevents reputation scores from remaining static.
- **Reputation-Based Access Control**: Permissions and voting power are based on reputation scores, ensuring that only participants with sufficient reputation can perform critical actions.

## 5. Implementation Guidelines

### 5.1 Performance Considerations
- **Efficient Ledger Access**: Use indexed data structures to enable efficient lookup and aggregation of reputation changes for each DID.
- **Scalable Design**: The system should support hundreds of thousands of reputation entries, ensuring smooth functioning even as the network scales.

### 5.2 Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: Include tests for key methods such as `modify_reputation`, `get_reputation_score`, and `is_eligible`.
- **Scenario-Based Testing**: Develop test scenarios for different participant behaviors, including positive and negative reputation changes, and ensure the system behaves as expected.

## 6. Future Considerations

### 6.1 Integration with Governance and Voting
Integrate reputation with voting weights, enabling participants with higher reputation scores to have more influence over non-critical decisions, while maintaining democratic equality for essential decisions.

### 6.2 Multi-Dimensional Reputation
Develop a multi-dimensional reputation system that allows different reputation categories (e.g., governance, resource sharing, technical contributions) to be tracked independently, providing a more nuanced view of each participant's contributions.

## Appendix

### A. Summary of Reputation Methods
- **Modify Reputation**: Adjusts the reputation score for a given entity, adding a new entry to the ledger.
- **Get Reputation Score**: Retrieves the current reputation score for a DID.
- **Check Eligibility**: Verifies if an entity meets the minimum reputation required for a given operation.

### B. Modular Structure

The reputation management modules are now split into smaller submodules for better separation of concerns. Below is the updated structure:

#### reputation/reputation_system.rs
- **reputation_tracking**: Handles the tracking and updating of reputation scores.
- **reputation_ledger**: Manages the immutable ledger of reputation changes.
- **reputation_verification**: Provides methods for verifying eligibility based on reputation scores.

#### relationship/types.rs
- **relationship_types**: Defines the types of relationships and interactions that can be tracked.

#### relationship/interaction.rs
- **interaction_tracking**: Manages the tracking of interactions and endorsements between entities.

### C. Federation-Related Reputation Mechanisms

The Reputation System also includes reputation-based access control and decay mechanisms for federations. These mechanisms ensure that only trusted members can influence critical decisions within federations and encourage continuous participation.

#### Reputation-Based Access Control
Permissions and voting power within federations are based on reputation scores. This ensures that only participants with sufficient reputation can perform critical actions, such as proposing actions, voting on proposals, or updating federation terms.

#### Reputation Decay
A decay mechanism gradually reduces reputation scores over time if participants do not engage in positive activities within federations. This encourages continuous participation and prevents reputation scores from remaining static.

#### Example: Reputation-Based Access Control
```rust
pub fn is_eligible_for_federation(&self, did: &str, min_reputation: i32, federation_id: &str) -> bool {
    self.get_reputation_score(did, "federation") >= min_reputation
}
```
- **Input**: `did` (identifier of the entity), `min_reputation` (minimum required reputation score), `federation_id` (ID of the federation).
- **Output**: Boolean indicating whether the entity is eligible for federation-related actions.

#### Example: Reputation Decay in Federations
```rust
pub fn apply_federation_decay(&mut self, did: &str, decay_rate: f64) {
    let current_score = self.get_reputation_score(did, "federation");
    let new_score = (current_score as f64 * (1.0 - decay_rate)) as i32;
    self.modify_reputation(did, new_score - current_score, "Reputation decay in federation", "federation");
}
```
- **Input**: `did` (identifier of the entity), `decay_rate` (rate of reputation decay).
- **Functionality**: Applies the decay rate to the reputation score within federations.
