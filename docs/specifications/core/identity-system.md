# Identity System Documentation

## Overview
The Identity System is a core component of the Inter-Cooperative Network (ICN). It provides decentralized identity management through the use of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs). This system facilitates secure interactions and permissions management across the network, allowing for authentication and authorization of cooperative members.

### Purpose
- **Decentralized Identity Management**: The Identity System provides a framework for creating and managing DIDs for all participants in the network.
- **Authentication and Access Control**: It supports secure authentication processes and manages permissions associated with each DID.
- **Integration with Cooperative Services**: The system ties into other ICN services like resource sharing, governance, and consensus.

## 1. System Components

### 1.1 Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)
A DID is a cryptographic identifier representing users or entities within the ICN. DIDs are generated using cryptographic primitives for uniqueness and security.

#### DID Structure
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct DID {
    pub id: String,
    #[serde(serialize_with = "serialize_public_key")]
    #[serde(deserialize_with = "deserialize_public_key")]
    pub public_key: PublicKey,
}
```
- **id**: A unique identifier for each DID.
- **public_key**: The public key used for identity verification.

### 1.2 Identity System
The Identity System tracks registered DIDs, manages their permissions, and supports verification processes.

#### Identity System Structure
```rust
#[derive(Clone)]
pub struct IdentitySystem {
    permissions: HashMap<String, Vec<String>>,
    registered_dids: HashMap<String, DID>,
}
```
- **permissions**: Maps each DID to its assigned permissions.
- **registered_dids**: Stores the registered DIDs for verification and reference.

## 2. Key Methods

### 2.1 DID Generation
DIDs are generated using cryptographic methods to ensure both uniqueness and security. The function `generate_random` is used to create a new DID with an associated secret key.

```rust
pub fn generate_random(id: String) -> (DID, SecretKey) {
    let secp = Secp256k1::new();
    let mut rng = thread_rng();
    let mut secret_key_bytes = [0u8; 32];
    rng.fill_bytes(&mut secret_key_bytes);
    let secret_key = SecretKey::from_slice(&secret_key_bytes).expect("Valid key");
    let public_key = PublicKey::from_secret_key(&secp, &secret_key);
    (DID { id, public_key }, secret_key)
}
```
- **Input**: `id` - A string identifier for the DID.
- **Output**: A tuple containing the generated `DID` and its associated `SecretKey`.

### 2.2 Register DID
The `register_did` method registers a DID with the Identity System and assigns it permissions.

```rust
pub fn register_did(&mut self, did: DID, permissions: Vec<String>) {
    self.permissions.insert(did.id.clone(), permissions);
    self.registered_dids.insert(did.id.clone(), did);
}
```
- **Input**: `did` - The DID to be registered, `permissions` - A list of permissions to assign.
- **Functionality**: Adds the DID and permissions to the Identity System for future reference.

### 2.3 Get Permissions
The `get_permissions` method retrieves the permissions associated with a particular DID.

```rust
pub fn get_permissions(&self, did: &str) -> Vec<String> {
    self.permissions.get(did).cloned().unwrap_or_default()
}
```
- **Input**: `did` - The identifier for the DID.
- **Output**: A list of strings representing the permissions associated with the DID.

### 2.4 Verify DID Registration
The `is_registered` method checks if a DID is registered with the Identity System.

```rust
pub fn is_registered(&self, did: &str) -> bool {
    self.registered_dids.contains_key(did)
}
```
- **Input**: `did` - The DID to verify.
- **Output**: A boolean indicating whether the DID is registered.

### 2.5 Authentication
The Identity System authenticates DIDs using cryptographic verification. The `verify_did` function checks if the DID’s public key matches the stored public key.

```rust
pub fn verify_did(&self, did: &str) -> Result<bool, String> {
    if let Some(did_obj) = self.registered_dids.get(did) {
        // Verification logic
        Ok(true)
    } else {
        Err("DID not registered".to_string())
    }
}
```
- **Input**: `did` - The DID to verify.
- **Output**: A result indicating whether the DID is valid or an error message.

## 3. Permission Management

### 3.1 Adding and Removing Permissions
The Identity System allows dynamic updating of permissions for registered DIDs.

#### Add Permission
```rust
pub fn add_permission(&mut self, did: &str, permission: String) {
    if let Some(perms) = self.permissions.get_mut(did) {
        if !perms.contains(&permission) {
            perms.push(permission);
        }
    }
}
```
- **Input**: `did` - The DID to update, `permission` - The permission to add.

#### Remove Permission
```rust
pub fn remove_permission(&mut self, did: &str, permission: &str) {
    if let Some(perms) = self.permissions.get_mut(did) {
        perms.retain(|p| p != permission);
    }
}
```
- **Input**: `did` - The DID to update, `permission` - The permission to remove.

## 4. Security Considerations

### 4.1 Reputation-Based Access
Reputation scores are integrated into the Identity System to enhance security and ensure responsible access. Users must maintain a positive reputation to retain or gain permissions for critical operations.

### 4.2 Cryptographic Security
The Identity System uses Secp256k1 for generating DIDs and verifying public keys. Future updates may integrate quantum-resistant cryptographic methods to ensure long-term security.

### 4.3 Graceful Error Handling
The Identity System handles errors gracefully, providing meaningful error messages that aid in debugging while maintaining security.

## 5. Implementation Guidelines

### 5.1 Performance Requirements
- **Efficient Data Retrieval**: Use hash maps for O(1) lookup times for DID verification and permission retrieval.
- **Scalability**: Ensure the system is optimized for handling thousands of DIDs without significant performance overhead.

### 5.2 Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: Cover all core methods such as `register_did`, `add_permission`, and `verify_did`.
- **Integration Tests**: Verify that the Identity System integrates smoothly with other components like governance and reputation modules.

## 6. Future Considerations

### 6.1 Quantum-Resistant Keys
To future-proof the system against advancements in quantum computing, a migration to quantum-resistant algorithms (e.g., CRYSTALS-Dilithium) is under consideration.

### 6.2 DID Lifecycle Management
Adding lifecycle management for DIDs, including deactivation, expiration, and renewal, will enhance security and prevent unauthorized use of stale identities.

## Appendix

### A. Summary of Methods
- **Generate DID**: Creates a new decentralized identifier.
- **Register DID**: Adds a DID to the registry with permissions.
- **Verify DID**: Confirms a DID’s validity via cryptographic checks.
- **Permission Management**: Add or remove permissions for a DID as roles change.

### B. Modular Structure

The identity management modules are now split into smaller submodules for better separation of concerns. Below is the updated structure:

#### identity/did.rs
- **creation**: Handles the creation of DIDs.
- **serialization**: Manages the serialization and deserialization of DIDs.
- **validation**: Provides methods for signing and verifying messages.

#### identity/identity_system.rs
- **permission_handling**: Manages permissions associated with DIDs.
- **role_management**: Handles role assignments and retrievals.
- **identity_verification**: Provides methods for verifying DIDs using cryptographic signatures.
