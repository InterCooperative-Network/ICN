# Identity System

## Overview
The Identity System manages Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) for ICN members, cooperatives, and nodes, enabling secure and pseudonymous interactions. It supports both ECC keys and quantum-resistant CRYSTALS-Dilithium and CRYSTALS-Kyber keys for future-proof security.

### Purpose
- **Unique Identification**: Ensures each member and cooperative has a unique, verifiable identifier.
- **Secure Interactions**: Supports ECC and post-quantum cryptography for verification and encryption.
- **Transition to Quantum Resistance**: Gradually shift to quantum-resistant keys where needed.

## Data Structures

### DID
- **id**: `String` - Unique identifier for each entity.
- **public_key**: `PublicKey` - Public key for DID verification.
- **metadata** (planned): Optional metadata, including reputation and cooperative membership.

### Key Management
- **ECC (Secp256k1)**: Standard cryptographic key type, used initially for DID verification.
- **Quantum-Resistant Keys**: CRYSTALS-Dilithium (signatures) and CRYSTALS-Kyber (key exchange) for higher security.

## Methods

### DID Generation
Generates a new DID with a unique identifier and key pair, optionally quantum-resistant.

### DID Serialization
Provides secure, limited exposure by serializing only public data (ID, public key).

## Security Model
- **Hybrid Key Structure**: Supports both ECC and quantum-resistant cryptography.
- **DID Rotation**: Allows key rotation to prevent unauthorized access after key compromise.

## Future Extensions
- **DID Metadata Integration**: Add reputation and cooperative affiliation metadata within DIDs.
- **Cross-Cooperative Verification**: Enables federation of DIDs across cooperative networks.
