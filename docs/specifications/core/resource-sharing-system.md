# Resource Sharing System Documentation

## Overview

The Resource Sharing System is a critical component of the Inter-Cooperative Network (ICN). It allows cooperatives and federations to share, allocate, and manage resources effectively within the network. This system ensures that resources are utilized in a fair, efficient, and transparent manner, fostering collaboration and collective benefit.

### Purpose
- **Optimal Resource Utilization**: Facilitate the sharing of underutilized resources across the network to maximize value.
- **Equitable Access**: Ensure that all cooperatives and communities have fair access to shared resources based on their contributions and needs.
- **Transparent Allocation**: Maintain transparency in resource distribution to uphold trust and accountability among all participants.

## 1. System Components

### 1.1 Resource Types
The system supports various resource types, which may include:
- **Physical Resources**: Equipment, raw materials, vehicles, etc.
- **Digital Resources**: Storage capacity, bandwidth, software licenses.
- **Human Resources**: Specialized labor, skills, and expertise.

### 1.2 Resource Registry
The Resource Registry maintains an inventory of all shared resources, tracking their availability, ownership, and allocation status.

#### Resource Structure
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct Resource {
    pub resource_id: String,
    pub resource_type: String,
    pub owner: String,
    pub availability: ResourceAvailability,
    pub description: String,
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub enum ResourceAvailability {
    Available,
    Allocated,
    UnderMaintenance,
}
```
- **resource_id**: Unique identifier for each resource.
- **resource_type**: Type of the resource (physical, digital, or human).
- **owner**: DID of the entity owning the resource.
- **availability**: Current availability status of the resource.
- **description**: Details about the resource.

## 2. Key Methods

### 2.1 Registering a Resource
Resources can be registered by any cooperative member, adding them to the Resource Registry.

#### Register Resource
```rust
pub fn register_resource(&mut self, resource: Resource) {
    self.resources.insert(resource.resource_id.clone(), resource);
}
```
- **Input**: `resource` (Resource structure).
- **Functionality**: Adds the resource to the Resource Registry for potential sharing and allocation.

### 2.2 Requesting a Resource
Participants can request resources from the registry, specifying their needs and intended use.

#### Request Resource
```rust
pub fn request_resource(&mut self, resource_id: &str, requester: &str) -> Result<(), String> {
    if let Some(resource) = self.resources.get_mut(resource_id) {
        if let ResourceAvailability::Available = resource.availability {
            resource.availability = ResourceAvailability::Allocated;
            Ok(())
        } else {
            Err("Resource not available".to_string())
        }
    } else {
        Err("Resource not found".to_string())
    }
}
```
- **Input**: `resource_id` (ID of the resource), `requester` (DID of the requester).
- **Functionality**: Allocates the resource if it is available.

### 2.3 Releasing a Resource
Once a resource is no longer needed, it must be released back into the pool of available resources.

#### Release Resource
```rust
pub fn release_resource(&mut self, resource_id: &str) -> Result<(), String> {
    if let Some(resource) = self.resources.get_mut(resource_id) {
        if let ResourceAvailability::Allocated = resource.availability {
            resource.availability = ResourceAvailability::Available;
            Ok(())
        } else {
            Err("Resource is not currently allocated".to_string())
        }
    } else {
        Err("Resource not found".to_string())
    }
}
```
- **Input**: `resource_id` (ID of the resource).
- **Functionality**: Marks the resource as available again.

### 2.4 Updating Resource Information
Resource owners can update resource details, such as availability or description.

#### Update Resource
```rust
pub fn update_resource(&mut self, resource_id: &str, description: String, availability: ResourceAvailability) -> Result<(), String> {
    if let Some(resource) = self.resources.get_mut(resource_id) {
        resource.description = description;
        resource.availability = availability;
        Ok(())
    } else {
        Err("Resource not found".to_string())
    }
}
```
- **Input**: `resource_id` (ID of the resource), `description` (new description), `availability` (new availability status).
- **Functionality**: Updates the resource information accordingly.

## 3. Resource Sharing Policies

### 3.1 Fair Allocation Rules
- **Contribution-Based Access**: Members contributing more to the network are given priority access to shared resources.
- **Need-Based Consideration**: Resources may be allocated based on demonstrated need, ensuring equitable distribution.
- **Quotas**: Maximum usage quotas may be implemented to prevent overuse by any single participant.

### 3.2 Usage Tracking
All resource usage is tracked for accountability and transparency. This data helps determine reputation impacts and can inform future allocation decisions.

### 3.3 Maintenance and Downtime
- **Maintenance Scheduling**: Resources can be marked as `UnderMaintenance` during repair or upkeep.
- **Downtime Reporting**: Owners must report resource unavailability to prevent allocation during downtime.

## 4. Security Considerations

### 4.1 Preventing Resource Hoarding
- **Quota Enforcement**: Enforce quotas on resource usage to ensure fair access across the network.
- **Penalty Mechanisms**: Participants who hold onto resources without justification may receive negative reputation adjustments.

### 4.2 Transparency in Allocation
- **Public Resource Ledger**: Maintain a ledger that records all allocations, ensuring that resource sharing activities are auditable and transparent.

## 5. Implementation Guidelines

### 5.1 Performance Requirements
- **Efficient Resource Lookup**: Use hash maps for rapid lookup of available resources.
- **Scalable Registry Management**: Ensure that the Resource Registry can accommodate a growing number of resources and participants.

### 5.2 Testing Requirements
- **Unit Testing**: Include tests for resource registration, request, release, and update methods.
- **Scenario Testing**: Test common scenarios, such as concurrent requests for the same resource, to ensure robustness.

## 6. Future Considerations

### 6.1 Automated Matching
Develop automated matching algorithms to connect resource requests with available resources, optimizing allocation without manual intervention.

### 6.2 Incentive Structures
Introduce incentive mechanisms to encourage the sharing of high-value or scarce resources, such as bonus reputation points or cooperative recognition.

## Appendix

### A. Summary of Resource Methods
- **Register Resource**: Adds a new resource to the registry.
- **Request Resource**: Allocates an available resource to a requester.
- **Release Resource**: Returns an allocated resource back to available status.
- **Update Resource**: Updates the description or availability of a resource.
