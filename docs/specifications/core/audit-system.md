# Audit System Documentation

## Overview

The Audit System is a crucial component of the Inter-Cooperative Network (ICN), designed to provide transparency, accountability, and verification of actions, transactions, and decisions made across the network. It allows cooperative members to independently verify activities, ensuring integrity and adherence to cooperative principles. The system also supports dispute resolution by providing a comprehensive audit trail.

### Purpose
- **Transparency**: Ensure all decisions, actions, and resource allocations are openly documented and accessible for review by cooperative members.
- **Accountability**: Hold members and entities accountable for their actions through immutable audit logs.
- **Dispute Resolution**: Provide verified historical data that can be used to resolve disputes fairly and efficiently.

## 1. System Components

### 1.1 Audit Log
The Audit Log is an immutable record of all significant events and actions taken within the ICN. This includes proposals, votes, resource allocations, and policy implementations.

#### Audit Log Structure
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct AuditLog {
    pub entry_id: String,
    pub timestamp: u64,
    pub entity: String,
    pub action: String,
    pub details: String,
}
```
- **entry_id**: Unique identifier for each log entry.
- **timestamp**: Time when the action occurred.
- **entity**: DID of the entity responsible for the action.
- **action**: Type of action taken (e.g., ProposalSubmission, VoteCast).
- **details**: Additional information about the action.

### 1.2 Verifiable Claims
Verifiable claims are cryptographic assertions that provide proof of actions taken. These can be used to verify the validity of actions recorded in the Audit Log.

#### Verifiable Claim Structure
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct VerifiableClaim {
    pub claim_id: String,
    pub issuer: String,
    pub subject: String,
    pub claim_type: String,
    pub proof: String,
    pub issued_at: u64,
}
```
- **claim_id**: Unique identifier for the claim.
- **issuer**: DID of the entity issuing the claim.
- **subject**: DID of the entity subject to the claim.
- **claim_type**: Type of claim (e.g., VoteProof, ResourceAllocation).
- **proof**: Cryptographic proof supporting the claim.
- **issued_at**: Time when the claim was issued.

## 2. Key Methods

### 2.1 Creating an Audit Entry
All significant actions in ICN are recorded by creating a new entry in the Audit Log.

#### Create Audit Entry
```rust
pub fn create_audit_entry(&mut self, entry: AuditLog) {
    self.entries.insert(entry.entry_id.clone(), entry);
}
```
- **Input**: `entry` (AuditLog structure).
- **Functionality**: Adds an immutable record to the audit log.

### 2.2 Generating a Verifiable Claim
A verifiable claim can be generated for any action taken. This provides cryptographic proof of the action.

#### Generate Claim
```rust
pub fn generate_claim(&mut self, claim: VerifiableClaim) {
    self.claims.insert(claim.claim_id.clone(), claim);
}
```
- **Input**: `claim` (VerifiableClaim structure).
- **Functionality**: Adds a verifiable claim to the system, providing proof of the recorded action.

### 2.3 Querying the Audit Log
Members can query the audit log to review historical actions, verify compliance, or resolve disputes.

#### Query Audit Log
```rust
pub fn query_audit_log(&self, entry_id: &str) -> Option<&AuditLog> {
    self.entries.get(entry_id)
}
```
- **Input**: `entry_id` (ID of the audit entry).
- **Output**: The audit log entry, if found.

### 2.4 Verifying Claims
Claims can be verified to ensure that the recorded action is valid and has not been tampered with.

#### Verify Claim
```rust
pub fn verify_claim(&self, claim_id: &str) -> Result<bool, String> {
    if let Some(claim) = self.claims.get(claim_id) {
        // Logic to verify the cryptographic proof
        Ok(true)
    } else {
        Err("Claim not found".to_string())
    }
}
```
- **Input**: `claim_id` (ID of the claim).
- **Output**: A boolean indicating whether the claim is valid.

## 3. Security Considerations

### 3.1 Immutable Audit Trail
- **Tamper Resistance**: All entries in the audit log are immutable, ensuring that no entity can alter historical records.
- **Secure Cryptographic Proofs**: Claims are backed by cryptographic proofs that prevent unauthorized modifications.

### 3.2 Privacy and Data Protection
- **Pseudonymous Entries**: Audit log entries use DIDs to maintain participant privacy while ensuring accountability.
- **Access Control**: Only authorized members can generate claims or query sensitive audit entries.

## 4. Implementation Guidelines

### 4.1 Performance Requirements
- **Efficient Log Access**: Use indexed data structures to enable efficient lookup of audit entries.
- **Scalable Claim Generation**: Ensure that the system can generate and verify claims efficiently, even as the number of actions recorded grows.

### 4.2 Testing Requirements
- **Unit Testing**: Include tests for audit entry creation, claim generation, and verification methods.
- **Integrity Testing**: Ensure that all audit log entries remain immutable and verifiable over time, even under adverse conditions.

## 5. Future Considerations

### 5.1 Advanced Querying and Filtering
Develop advanced querying capabilities, allowing members to filter audit entries by action type, date range, or entity. This will enhance usability and aid in quickly finding relevant information.

### 5.2 Zero-Knowledge Proofs
Consider integrating zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to allow members to prove the validity of certain claims without revealing sensitive information, further enhancing privacy.
