# Virtual Machine (VM)

## Overview
The Virtual Machine (VM) is a core component of the ICN, responsible for executing cooperative-specific contracts. It interprets a set of predefined OpCodes, allowing for a range of operations that support governance, resource allocation, and cooperative management.

### Purpose
- **Contract Execution**: Execute cooperative contracts securely within ICN.
- **Reputation Validation**: Enforce reputation-based permissions for contract execution.
- **Event Emission**: Generate events to log contract activity and state changes.

## Data Structures

### OpCode
Defines actions supported by the VM, categorized by function:
- **Arithmetic Operations**: `Add`, `Sub`, `Mul`, `Div`, `Mod`
- **Stack Operations**: `Push`, `Pop`, `Dup`, `Swap`
- **Memory Operations**: `Store`, `Load`
- **Cooperative Operations**: `CreateCooperative`, `JoinCooperative`, `AllocateResource`
- **Governance Operations**: `CreateProposal`, `CastVote`, `UpdateQuorum`

### Contract
Defines contract structure, including:
- **code**: `Vec<(OpCode, Option<i64>)>` - List of OpCodes and optional arguments.
- **state**: `HashMap<String, i64>` - Contract-specific state.
- **required_reputation**: `i64` - Minimum reputation required to execute.
- **cooperative_metadata**: `CooperativeMetadata` - Metadata defining cooperative context.

## Methods

### Execute Contract
Runs a contract step-by-step, processing each OpCode based on available reputation and context.

### Execute Instruction
Processes individual OpCodes and modifies stack, memory, or contract state as needed.

### Event Emission
Generates events for actions like `ResourceAllocated`, `ProposalCreated`, allowing tracking and auditing.

## Implementation Guidelines
- **Stack Management**: Ensure consistent stack state for predictable operations.
- **Error Handling**: Implement clear error messages, especially for common issues like stack underflow.

## Monitoring and Metrics
- **Execution Logs**: Track each contractâ€™s OpCode flow for debugging.
- **Event Audits**: Maintain event history for accountability.
