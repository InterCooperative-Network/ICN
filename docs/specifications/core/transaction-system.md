# Transaction Lifecycle System

## Overview
The Transaction Lifecycle System provides a secure, traceable, and immutable process for handling all cooperative transactions within the ICN. This document details the lifecycle of a transaction, from initiation and validation to finalization and storage in the blockchain. The system is designed to ensure consistency, security, and transparency in all cooperative actions.

### Purpose
- **Immutability**: Maintain a secure and unalterable record of all transactions.
- **Traceability**: Allow cooperatives to track resource allocation, proposal voting, and other actions.
- **Accountability**: Ensure all actions align with ICN's governance standards through DID and reputation validation.

### Components Involved
- **Blockchain Module**: Manages the chain of blocks where transactions are stored.
- **DID System**: Verifies the identities of transaction participants.
- **Reputation System**: Validates that users have the necessary reputation to execute actions.

## 1. Transaction Lifecycle

### 1.1 Transaction Initiation

1. **Process**:
   - A transaction is created with the following attributes: `sender`, `receiver`, `amount`, `timestamp`, and `purpose`.
   - A unique transaction hash is generated using `SHA-256` to prevent duplicates.

2. **Validation**:
   - The transaction undergoes an initial validation to confirm that the `sender` has a valid DID and that the specified `amount` respects the cooperative’s resource allocation limits.

3. **Attributes**:
   - **Sender**: The DID of the transaction initiator.
   - **Receiver**: The DID of the transaction recipient.
   - **Amount**: The value/resource quantity being transferred.
   - **Timestamp**: Millisecond timestamp of transaction initiation.
   - **Purpose**: A brief description of the transaction’s intent.

### 1.2 Transaction Validation

1. **DID Verification**:
   - Ensure that both the `sender` and `receiver` have valid DIDs. Invalid or nonexistent DIDs will cause the transaction to fail validation.
   
2. **Reputation Check**:
   - Confirm that the `sender` meets any minimum reputation thresholds required by the transaction type.
   - If the reputation requirement is not met, the transaction is rejected with an error.

3. **Signature Verification**:
   - The transaction must be signed by the `sender`’s key, verified using ECC (secp256k1) or, when specified, quantum-resistant keys (CRYSTALS-Dilithium).
   
4. **Timestamp Verification**:
   - Check that the `timestamp` is valid and aligns with recent blockchain activity to prevent replay attacks.

### 1.3 Transaction Processing

1. **Hashing**:
   - Calculate a unique hash for the transaction, incorporating attributes like `sender`, `receiver`, `amount`, and `timestamp`.
   
2. **Pending Pool**:
   - Place the validated transaction in the pending transactions pool until a new block is finalized.

### 1.4 Block Finalization

1. **Block Creation**:
   - At defined intervals or upon reaching a set number of transactions, pending transactions are bundled into a new block.
   
2. **Block Hashing**:
   - A hash of the new block is computed, linking it to the previous block for chain integrity.
   
3. **Chain Update**:
   - The finalized block is added to the blockchain, and the pending transactions pool is cleared.

### 2.1 Transaction Object

```rust
Transaction {
    sender: String,
    receiver: String,
    amount: u64,
    timestamp: u128,
    hash: String,
}
