# ICN CI/CD Pipeline Guide

## Overview

The Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline is a vital component of the ICN development process. It helps ensure code quality, automate testing, and streamline the deployment of new features and updates. This guide provides an overview of the CI/CD practices in ICN, including how new contributions are tested, built, and released.

### Purpose
- **Automate Testing**: Ensure that new code is properly tested before being merged.
- **Efficient Deployment**: Automate the deployment process to minimize human error and expedite releases.
- **Quality Assurance**: Enforce code quality and integration standards to keep ICN stable and reliable.

## 1. Tools and Technologies

### 1.1 GitHub Actions
GitHub Actions is used as the primary CI/CD tool for managing workflows related to code testing, linting, and deployment.

- **Workflows**: Defined in the `.github/workflows` directory as YAML files.
- **Trigger Events**: Actions are triggered on specific events, such as `push`, `pull_request`, or on a scheduled basis.

### 1.2 Docker
Docker is used to containerize ICN applications, ensuring consistency between development, testing, and production environments.

- **Docker Images**: Built automatically during the CI process to verify that applications work as expected in a containerized environment.

### 1.3 Kubernetes (Minikube)
For testing in a simulated production environment, Minikube is used to create a local Kubernetes cluster to manage container orchestration.

- **Integration Testing**: Kubernetes is used to validate services interacting within ICN, ensuring that the orchestration layer works as intended.

### 1.4 Codecov
Codecov is used for test coverage analysis, ensuring that new contributions maintain or improve overall test coverage.

- **Reports**: Automatically generated and linked to pull requests, providing transparency on the quality of test coverage.

## 2. CI/CD Pipeline Stages

### 2.1 Continuous Integration (CI)

#### 2.1.1 Linting and Formatting
The first step in the CI process is to validate that all code follows ICNâ€™s style guides and formatting standards.

- **Rust**: `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` are used to enforce Rust coding standards.
- **JavaScript**: `eslint` is used to ensure consistency in JavaScript code.

#### 2.1.2 Unit Testing
All code changes must pass unit tests to verify individual components' behavior.

- **Rust Unit Tests**: Triggered via `cargo test` to validate backend components.
- **JavaScript Unit Tests**: Executed using `jest` for front-end logic and React components.

#### 2.1.3 Build Verification
A Docker image is built as part of the CI process to verify that the application builds correctly.

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Docker Buildx
      uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v1
    - name: Build Docker image
      run: docker build -t icn-app:latest .
```

### 2.2 Continuous Deployment (CD)

#### 2.2.1 Integration Testing
Integration tests verify that ICN services interact correctly.

- **Minikube Deployment**: Services are deployed on a local Minikube cluster to validate the full environment.
- **Service Verification**: Automated tests check that key services can communicate and perform intended operations (e.g., identity verification, resource allocation).

#### 2.2.2 Staging Environment Deployment
After successful integration tests, changes are deployed to the staging environment for further validation.

- **Docker Compose**: Used for orchestrating multi-service environments in staging.
- **Manual QA**: Maintainers and QA contributors manually test newly deployed features in staging to catch edge cases and usability issues.

#### 2.2.3 Production Deployment
If all tests pass in the staging environment, code is merged into the `main` branch and automatically deployed to production.

- **Rolling Deployments**: Kubernetes is used to perform rolling updates to avoid downtime and ensure seamless upgrades.
- **Deployment Monitoring**: Grafana and Prometheus are used to monitor the health of production services during and after deployment.

## 3. Writing and Running Tests

### 3.1 Unit Tests
- **Backend**: Write unit tests for all new Rust code using `cargo test`. Every public function should have corresponding tests.
- **Frontend**: Use `jest` for JavaScript testing, with `react-testing-library` for React components.

### 3.2 Integration Tests
Integration tests should cover the interaction between ICN components.

- **REST API Testing**: Use `reqwest` in Rust or `axios` in JavaScript to simulate API calls and validate responses.
- **Kubernetes Testing**: Use `kubectl` scripts to deploy components on Minikube and check for correct orchestration.

### 3.3 End-to-End Testing
End-to-end (E2E) tests simulate real-world user interactions across multiple services to verify full workflow integrity.

- **Cypress**: Use Cypress for testing front-end and backend integrations by simulating user interactions in a browser.

## 4. Best Practices for CI/CD

### 4.1 Fail Fast
The pipeline should fail as early as possible to avoid wasting time on subsequent steps if there is a critical issue.

- **Early Linting**: Run linting and formatting checks before executing any build processes.
- **Parallel Jobs**: Run independent tests (e.g., unit tests, integration tests) in parallel to speed up the CI process.

### 4.2 Automate Rollbacks
If an issue is detected in production after deployment, an automated rollback is initiated.

- **Kubernetes Rollbacks**: Use Kubernetes `kubectl rollout undo` to revert to a previous stable version.

### 4.3 Use Secrets Securely
Sensitive information (e.g., API keys, credentials) must be stored securely in GitHub Secrets or Kubernetes Secrets.

- **Access Management**: Limit access to secrets to only the stages or jobs that require them.

## 5. Setting Up the CI/CD Pipeline

### 5.1 GitHub Actions Configuration
Create or modify YAML workflows under `.github/workflows/` to define CI/CD processes.

#### Example Workflow Configuration
```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Run Linter
      run: |
        cargo fmt --all -- --check
        cargo clippy -- -D warnings
        npm run lint
```

### 5.2 Kubernetes Deployment Scripts
Use `kubectl` deployment scripts to automate staging and production deployments.

- **Staging Deployment**: `kubectl apply -f k8s/staging/`
- **Production Deployment**: `kubectl apply -f k8s/production/`

## 6. Optimizing Build and Deployment Processes

### 6.1 Docker Multi-Stage Builds
Docker multi-stage builds are used to reduce the size of the final images and improve build times. This approach separates the build environment from the runtime environment, ensuring that only the necessary components are included in the final image.

### 6.2 Caching Mechanisms
Implementing caching mechanisms in the CI pipeline can significantly speed up the build process. This includes caching dependencies and Docker layers.

- **Cargo Dependencies**: Cache Cargo dependencies to avoid re-downloading them for every build.
- **Docker Layers**: Use the `actions/cache` action in GitHub Actions to cache Docker layers.
- **Frontend Dependencies**: Cache frontend dependencies similar to how Cargo dependencies are cached.

### 6.3 Shared Cache for Test Results
Using a shared cache for test results can help avoid redundant test executions when the code hasn't changed. This ensures that only the necessary tests are run, saving time and resources.

## 7. Automated Deployment with Kubernetes and Helm

### 7.1 Kubernetes and Helm Charts
Automate the deployment process to staging and production environments using Kubernetes and Helm charts. This provides better management and scalability.

- **Helm Charts**: Use Helm charts to manage Kubernetes deployments for staging and production environments.
- **Automated Rollbacks**: Implement automated rollbacks in case of deployment failures using Kubernetes' built-in rollback mechanisms.
- **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)**: Use Kubernetes' Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to automatically scale the application based on resource usage.

## 8. CI/CD Pipeline Steps

### 8.1 CI/CD Pipeline Configuration
To ensure the CI/CD pipeline is correctly configured, follow these steps:

- **Verify Workflow Configuration**: Check the workflow configuration file, such as `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, to ensure it includes all necessary steps for building, testing, and deploying the project.
- **Ensure Proper Caching**: Verify that caching mechanisms are in place for dependencies and build artifacts to speed up the CI/CD process. For example, the `ci.yml` file includes caching for Cargo, Docker layers, frontend dependencies, and test results.
- **Run Tests**: Ensure that unit tests, integration tests, and any other relevant tests are executed as part of the CI/CD pipeline. In the `ci.yml` file, unit tests and integration tests are run using `cargo test`.
- **Check Environment Setup**: Confirm that the necessary environment variables and secrets are configured correctly in the CI/CD pipeline. This includes database URLs, API keys, and other sensitive information.
- **Monitor Test Coverage**: Integrate tools like Codecov to monitor test coverage and ensure that all critical paths are adequately tested. This can be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.
- **Review Docker Configurations**: Verify that Dockerfiles and Docker Compose configurations are set up correctly for building and deploying the project. For example, `docker/backend.Dockerfile` and `docker/docker-compose.yml` should be reviewed.
- **Automate Deployment**: Ensure that the deployment process is automated and includes steps for deploying to staging and production environments. This can be done using Kubernetes and Helm charts.
- **Monitor Pipeline Performance**: Regularly review the performance of the CI/CD pipeline to identify and address any bottlenecks or issues. This includes monitoring build times, test execution times, and deployment durations.

## Appendix
