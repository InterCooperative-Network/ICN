# ICN Testing Roadmap

## Overview

The ICN Testing Roadmap provides a structured plan for expanding and improving the testing infrastructure of the Inter-Cooperative Network. This roadmap aims to guide the development of a comprehensive testing suite, achieving higher test coverage, automating as many processes as possible, and ensuring robust system reliability through structured timelines and well-defined milestones.

### Purpose
- **Coverage Expansion**: Systematically improve test coverage to include all components of ICN.
- **Automation Goals**: Automate key testing stages to reduce manual effort and accelerate release cycles.
- **Reliability Improvements**: Implement new testing approaches to identify and address reliability issues before deployment.

## 1. Testing Roadmap Phases

### 1.1 Phase 1: Foundation of Testing Suite
**Timeline**: Q1 2024 - Q2 2024

- **Unit Test Coverage Expansion**:
  - Focus on key backend modules: Identity, Reputation, and Voting systems.
  - Aim for 80% coverage across all core modules.
- **CI/CD Integration**:
  - Establish automated unit testing within GitHub Actions.
  - Configure Codecov to track and report coverage metrics on all pull requests.
- **Basic Integration Testing**:
  - Implement initial integration tests for API endpoints, focusing on core transactions and responses.

### 1.2 Phase 2: Integration and Load Testing
**Timeline**: Q3 2024 - Q4 2024

- **Full Integration Test Suite**:
  - Create integration tests covering all backend services, including Resource Allocation and Federation.
  - Deploy tests in a Kubernetes environment using Minikube.
- **E2E Test Development**:
  - Develop end-to-end (E2E) tests using Cypress to validate user flows: onboarding, voting, and resource sharing.
- **Load Testing Framework**:
  - Implement load testing using `k6` to evaluate system behavior under high concurrency scenarios.
  - Capture and analyze metrics such as response time, latency, and system throughput.

### 1.3 Phase 3: Comprehensive Performance and Security Testing
**Timeline**: Q1 2025 - Q2 2025

- **Stress and Performance Testing**:
  - Expand on load testing with stress tests to determine breaking points.
  - Develop benchmarks for transaction speeds and scalability metrics.
- **Security Testing**:
  - Conduct penetration testing and vulnerability scans.
  - Develop automated tests for access control and ensure that permissions function as intended across services.
- **Data Integrity Tests**:
  - Create tests to verify the consistency of blockchain transactions and state data during integration and after updates.

### 1.4 Phase 4: Automation and Regression Testing
**Timeline**: Q3 2025 - Q4 2025

- **Full Regression Test Suite**:
  - Build a regression test suite to automate the testing of previously validated features whenever new changes are introduced.
  - Automate deployment and testing cycles using GitHub Actions and Kubernetes.
- **Automated Rollbacks**:
  - Integrate automated rollback testing for Kubernetes deployments, ensuring seamless rollback if issues arise in production.
- **Test Data Automation**:
  - Develop scripts for generating and managing test data automatically, ensuring consistency and reducing manual setup time.

## 2. Key Milestones

### 2.1 Coverage Milestones
- **80% Unit Test Coverage** (Q2 2024): Achieve 80% unit test coverage for core backend and frontend components.
- **95% Critical Coverage** (Q1 2025): Achieve close to 95% coverage for critical modules, including Governance and Reputation systems.

### 2.2 Test Automation Milestones
- **CI/CD Automated Testing Integration** (Q2 2024): Integrate unit, integration, and E2E tests into the CI/CD pipeline for every pull request.
- **Automated Load Testing** (Q4 2024): Set up automated load testing for key workflows (e.g., voting, onboarding).

### 2.3 Reliability and Stability Milestones
- **Comprehensive Stress Testing** (Q2 2025): Complete stress testing for backend services and assess system recovery capabilities.
- **Continuous Regression Testing** (Q4 2025): Fully automate regression testing as part of every release cycle to avoid introducing regressions.

## 3. Testing Expansion Goals

### 3.1 Increase Test Coverage for Edge Cases
- **Unhappy Paths**: Expand tests to cover failure scenarios, such as invalid inputs, network failures, and permission issues.
- **Boundary Conditions**: Ensure that tests include boundary value analysis for numerical inputs and constraints.

### 3.2 UI/UX Testing Automation
- **Visual Regression Testing**: Use tools like Percy or BackstopJS to automate visual checks, ensuring that UI changes do not inadvertently break user interfaces.
- **Usability Tests**: Develop automated tests for common user flows to validate accessibility and usability, particularly for onboarding and critical interactions.

### 3.3 Real-World Simulation Tests
- **User Behavior Simulation**: Implement E2E tests that simulate typical user behavior under different load conditions, including varying network speeds.
- **Cross-Device Testing**: Ensure compatibility by expanding Cypress tests to cover different devices (desktop, tablet, mobile) and browsers.

## 4. Challenges and Considerations

### 4.1 Handling Flaky Tests
- **Identify Causes**: Track and analyze flaky tests, particularly in integration and E2E tests, to determine root causes.
- **Retry Mechanism**: Implement test retries in CI/CD for non-deterministic failures, but strive to fix the root causes rather than mask issues.

### 4.2 Managing Test Data
- **Data Isolation**: Ensure that test data is isolated for each run to prevent data corruption or race conditions.
- **Dynamic Data Generation**: Develop utilities that dynamically generate data based on the context of the test to improve flexibility and reliability.

## 5. Future Directions

### 5.1 AI-Driven Testing
- **Automated Test Generation**: Investigate AI-based solutions to generate unit and integration tests based on code analysis.
- **Intelligent Test Prioritization**: Use machine learning to prioritize tests that are most likely to identify defects based on changes in the codebase.

### 5.2 Community Involvement
- **Testing Sprints**: Host community-driven testing sprints to engage cooperative members in validating features and sharing usability feedback.
- **Open Bug Bounty**: Introduce a bug bounty program to incentivize external testers to identify vulnerabilities and issues in the system.
