# ICN Testing Strategy Guide

## Overview

The ICN Testing Strategy ensures the quality and reliability of the Inter-Cooperative Network through structured, automated, and thorough testing processes. The goal is to guarantee that all ICN components, from the backend to the frontend, work cohesively and as intended while maintaining robustness during system updates. This guide outlines the methodologies and tools used for testing ICN at various stages of development and deployment.

### Purpose
- **Quality Assurance**: Verify that each component meets its intended purpose without introducing errors.
- **Risk Mitigation**: Identify and fix bugs before they reach staging or production environments.
- **Maintainability**: Ensure that code changes do not negatively impact existing functionality.

## 1. Types of Testing

### 1.1 Unit Testing
Unit tests validate the smallest components of the application in isolation to ensure they perform as intended.

- **Backend (Rust)**: Use `cargo test` for validating individual functions and modules within the Rust codebase.
- **Frontend (JavaScript)**: Use `jest` for unit testing JavaScript functions and React components, ensuring each piece behaves as expected.

#### Best Practices
- **Isolated Tests**: Tests should not have dependencies on other units to avoid cascading failures.
- **Fast Execution**: Unit tests should run quickly, allowing for fast feedback during development.

### 1.2 Integration Testing
Integration tests ensure that different ICN modules interact correctly with one another.

- **API Testing**: Validate that API endpoints respond correctly and that the backend services communicate as expected using `reqwest` in Rust or `axios` in JavaScript.
- **Kubernetes Integration**: Deploy ICN services in a local Minikube cluster to confirm their interoperability.

#### Best Practices
- **Data Consistency**: Use a consistent set of mock data to ensure tests are repeatable and results are reliable.
- **Testing Dependencies**: Check how components react to both positive and negative outcomes of dependent services.

### 1.3 End-to-End (E2E) Testing
E2E tests simulate real-world scenarios by testing the entire workflow, from the user interface to backend services.

- **Tools**: Use Cypress for simulating and validating complete user flows, including user registration, voting, and resource allocation.
- **Purpose**: Ensure that features like voting, reputation adjustment, or resource transactions behave correctly when used in full workflows.

#### Best Practices
- **User Perspective**: Write tests from the perspective of end-users to validate that features work as expected.
- **Run in CI/CD**: Include E2E tests as part of the CI/CD pipeline to catch workflow issues early.

## 2. Testing Environments

### 2.1 Local Environment
Developers can run unit and basic integration tests locally before pushing code.

- **Unit Tests**: Run locally using `cargo test` or `npm test` for Rust and JavaScript code respectively.
- **Dockerized Services**: Use Docker Compose to spin up required services (e.g., databases) for testing interactions locally.

### 2.2 Staging Environment
Staging is a pre-production environment used to validate how new changes affect the entire system.

- **Integration Tests**: Deploy services to a Kubernetes cluster in Minikube or a cloud-based staging environment.
- **Manual QA**: Maintainers and QA engineers perform manual exploratory testing to validate UI/UX consistency and usability.

## 3. CI/CD Testing Integration

### 3.1 Linting and Static Analysis
- **GitHub Actions**: Linting and static analysis are the first steps of the CI pipeline to ensure that the code adheres to formatting and quality standards.
- **Rust Tools**: Use `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` to automatically format and lint Rust code.
- **JavaScript Tools**: Use `eslint` to check for JavaScript code quality and consistency.

### 3.2 Automated Test Execution
Testing is automated within the CI/CD pipeline to catch regressions early.

- **Unit Tests**: Automatically run using GitHub Actions on every push and pull request.
- **Integration Tests**: Triggered once unit tests pass, focusing on backend and API interactions.
- **E2E Tests**: Scheduled to run after integration tests, verifying entire workflows with Cypress.

### 3.3 Test Coverage
- **Codecov Integration**: Test coverage is monitored via Codecov to ensure that changes do not reduce the quality of the test coverage.
- **Coverage Targets**: Aim for at least 80% coverage for new code. Critical modules (e.g., identity, governance) should have close to 100% coverage.

## 4. Test Data Management

### 4.1 Mock Data
Mock data is used extensively to ensure tests are deterministic.

- **Backend Tests**: Mock databases and API responses using tools like `mockall` in Rust.
- **Frontend Tests**: Use libraries like `nock` to mock HTTP requests in JavaScript tests.

### 4.2 Test Databases
- **Dockerized Database**: Spin up a test database using Docker, seeded with initial data required for integration tests.
- **Data Reset**: Ensure that each test run resets the state to maintain isolation and prevent tests from affecting each other.

## 5. Performance and Load Testing

### 5.1 Load Testing
Load testing is crucial to understanding how ICN performs under high usage.

- **Tools**: Use `k6` to simulate multiple concurrent users accessing services such as voting, reputation calculations, or resource requests.
- **Metrics Captured**: Response times, throughput, and error rates under different load conditions.

### 5.2 Stress Testing
Stress tests identify the systemâ€™s breaking point and help in understanding the recovery process.

- **Approach**: Increase load gradually until system failure occurs. Capture logs to determine failure points and evaluate strategies for resilience.

## 6. Testing Best Practices

### 6.1 Test-Driven Development (TDD)
Encourage TDD practices where feasible to ensure that functionality is clearly defined before implementation begins.

- **Write Tests First**: Write unit tests before implementing new functionality to define expected behavior.

### 6.2 Consistent Testing Standards
- **Code Review**: Ensure that all code submissions include appropriate tests and that those tests meet the quality bar established by ICN.
- **Test Naming Conventions**: Use descriptive names for test cases that clearly indicate the purpose and expected result (e.g., `test_calculate_reputation_with_valid_input`).

### 6.3 CI/CD Pipeline Integration
All tests, from unit to E2E, should be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to provide automated feedback on code quality.

- **Fast Feedback**: Ensure unit tests provide rapid feedback, ideally within a few minutes, while integration and E2E tests may take longer.

## 7. Manual Testing and QA

### 7.1 Exploratory Testing
Manual QA involves exploratory testing in both the staging environment and during development sprints to identify UI/UX issues, edge cases, and usability problems.

- **Focus Areas**: Test critical user paths like resource allocation, voting, and onboarding to ensure they work seamlessly.

### 7.2 User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
UAT ensures that the product meets the needs of real users before production deployment.

- **Beta Users**: Invite a select group of cooperative members to test new features and gather feedback.
- **Feedback Integration**: Use feedback from UAT to improve usability and address any gaps before release.
