# ICN Contribution Guide

## Overview

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Inter-Cooperative Network (ICN)! Contributions are essential to the growth and success of ICN, and we welcome community members of all experience levels to get involved. This guide outlines how you can start contributing, coding standards, the contribution workflow, and best practices to ensure a smooth process for everyone.

### Purpose
- **Inclusivity**: Provide guidelines to make contributing accessible to new and experienced developers alike.
- **Quality**: Maintain high code quality through consistent standards and peer reviews.
- **Efficiency**: Streamline the contribution process to make it efficient for both contributors and maintainers.

## 1. Getting Started

### 1.1 Prerequisites
- **Development Environment**: Set up your local development environment by following the [Development Setup Guide](../setup/development-setup-guide.md).
- **Familiarity with ICN**: Review the [ICN Overview](../../architecture/overview.md) to understand the purpose and architecture of the network.
- **GitHub Account**: Ensure you have a GitHub account, as contributions are managed via pull requests on GitHub.

### 1.2 Contribution Areas
You can contribute to ICN in various ways:
- **Code Contributions**: Add new features, fix bugs, or improve existing code.
- **Documentation**: Enhance the quality and accuracy of ICN documentation.
- **Testing**: Write unit, integration, or end-to-end tests.
- **Discussion and Ideas**: Share your insights in our [Community Discussion Board](https://community.icncoop.org/).

## 2. Issue Management

### 2.1 Finding an Issue
Browse our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/your-repo/icn/issues) to find something that interests you. Issues are typically labeled to help you decide where to contribute:
- **Good First Issue**: These are suitable for new contributors.
- **Bug**: Issues describing a problem that needs fixing.
- **Feature Request**: Ideas for new functionality.
- **Documentation**: Improvements to ICN’s documentation.

### 2.2 Reporting an Issue
If you’ve found a bug or have an idea for a new feature, you can create a new issue:
1. **Check Existing Issues**: Avoid duplicates by searching for existing issues.
2. **Create a New Issue**: Use our [Issue Template](https://github.com/your-repo/icn/issues/new) to ensure all necessary details are provided.

## 3. Development Workflow

### 3.1 Fork the Repository
Start by forking the main ICN repository to your GitHub account.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/icn.git
cd icn
git remote add upstream https://github.com/your-repo/icn.git
```
This creates a local copy of your fork and sets the original repository as the `upstream` remote.

### 3.2 Create a New Branch
Create a feature or bugfix branch from the latest `main` branch.

```bash
git checkout -b feature/new-awesome-feature
```
- Use descriptive branch names, such as `feature/`, `bugfix/`, or `docs/` prefixes.

### 3.3 Implement Changes
Make your changes locally. Ensure that your code adheres to the ICN coding standards:
- **Rust Code**: Run `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` to format and lint your Rust code.
- **JavaScript Code**: Run `eslint` to maintain consistent JS code formatting.

### 3.4 Commit Your Changes
Write clear, concise commit messages that describe what you have done.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Implement new reputation calculation method"
```
- **Best Practice**: Use the imperative mood in commit messages (e.g., “Add feature” instead of “Added feature”).

### 3.5 Push to Your Fork
Push your branch to your forked repository on GitHub.

```bash
git push origin feature/new-awesome-feature
```

### 3.6 Submit a Pull Request
Navigate to your repository on GitHub, and you should see an option to create a pull request (PR).
- **Title**: Use a descriptive title for your PR.
- **Description**: Provide a detailed description of what the PR does, including the context, approach, and any areas that need special review.

### 3.7 Address PR Feedback
Your PR will be reviewed by other contributors and maintainers. Be responsive to feedback and make changes as requested.
- **Discussions**: Use GitHub comments to discuss changes with reviewers.
- **Revisions**: Push new commits to your branch to address feedback.

## 4. Coding Standards

### 4.1 Rust Standards
- **Formatting**: Use `cargo fmt` to format code to maintain consistency.
- **Linting**: Use `cargo clippy` to identify common errors and style violations.
- **Documentation**: All public functions should be documented using Rust doc comments (`///`).

### 4.2 JavaScript Standards
- **Formatting**: Use ESLint with the provided configuration.
- **Naming Conventions**: Use `camelCase` for variables and functions.
- **Avoid Mutability**: Prefer `const` and `let` instead of `var`. Write pure functions when possible.

## 5. Testing Guidelines

### 5.1 Write Unit Tests
All new features must include unit tests to validate functionality.
- **Rust**: Use the built-in `cargo test` framework.
- **JavaScript**: Write tests using `jest` to verify logic for front-end components.

### 5.2 Run All Tests Before Submitting a PR
Ensure all tests pass locally before submitting your PR.

```bash
cargo test
npm test
```
- **Continuous Integration**: All pull requests are automatically tested by our CI/CD pipeline. Make sure your changes are compatible.

## 6. Code Review Process

### 6.1 Peer Review
All contributions must be reviewed by at least one other contributor before they are merged.
- **What Reviewers Look For**: Code correctness, adherence to standards, clarity, and whether the changes align with ICN’s overall architecture.
- **Suggestions**: Reviewers may suggest changes that improve performance, readability, or maintainability.

### 6.2 Merging Pull Requests
- Once approved, a maintainer will merge your PR. The `main` branch must always be stable, so PRs should only be merged after all tests pass.

## 7. Best Practices for Contributors

### 7.1 Communication
- **Ask Questions**: If you’re unsure about something, feel free to ask questions on GitHub or our [Community Discussion Board](https://community.icncoop.org/).
- **Be Respectful**: Provide constructive feedback and appreciate the efforts of others.

### 7.2 Stay Updated
- **Sync with Upstream**: Regularly update your fork with changes from the `upstream` repository to stay up-to-date.

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
```
