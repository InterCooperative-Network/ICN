# Resource Management Guide

## Introduction
Resource management within ICN allows cooperatives to allocate, share, and track resources efficiently. This guide covers the steps for creating resources, allocating them within a cooperative, and monitoring usage.

## Step 1: Create a Resource
1. Go to the Cooperative Resource tab.
2. Select “Create Resource” and provide details:
   - **Resource Type**: Define the type (e.g., funds, materials).
   - **Allocation**: Set initial availability and allocation limits.

## Step 2: Allocate Resource to Cooperative Members
1. Navigate to the Resource Allocation tab.
2. Select the resource and member(s) to allocate.
3. Set allocation limits based on cooperative needs.

## Step 3: Monitor Resource Usage
Regularly check the resource usage dashboard:
- **Allocated Resources**: Overview of allocated resources and remaining capacity.
- **Usage Trends**: Track member usage patterns to optimize future allocations.

## Tips for Effective Resource Management
- **Set Clear Limits**: Prevent overuse by establishing maximum allocations.
- **Review Allocation Periodically**: Adjust allocations based on changing cooperative needs.
- **Encourage Resource Sharing**: Promote shared resource access among members to maximize utility.
