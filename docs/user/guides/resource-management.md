# Resource Management Guide

## Introduction
Resource management within ICN allows cooperatives to allocate, share, and track resources efficiently. This guide covers the steps for creating resources, allocating them within a cooperative, and monitoring usage.

## Step 1: Create a Resource
1. Go to the Cooperative Resource tab.
2. Select “Create Resource” and provide details:
   - **Resource Type**: Define the type (e.g., funds, materials).
   - **Allocation**: Set initial availability and allocation limits.

## Step 2: Allocate Resource to Cooperative Members
1. Navigate to the Resource Allocation tab.
2. Select the resource and member(s) to allocate.
3. Set allocation limits based on cooperative needs.

## Step 3: Monitor Resource Usage
Regularly check the resource usage dashboard:
- **Allocated Resources**: Overview of allocated resources and remaining capacity.
- **Usage Trends**: Track member usage patterns to optimize future allocations.

## Step 4: Cross-Federation Resource Sharing 
1. Navigate to the Federation Resource tab.
2. Select "Share Resources" and provide details:
   - **Federation ID**: ID of the target federation
   - **Resource Type**: Type of resource being shared
   - **Amount**: Quantity to share
   - **Duration**: Optional sharing duration
   - **Terms**: Allocation and usage terms

## Best Practices for Federation Resource Sharing
- Maintain adequate resource reserves for your primary federation
- Document clear access policies and terms of use
- Monitor shared resource usage across federations
- Establish reciprocal sharing agreements where beneficial

## Managing Federation Resource Pools
- **Resource Pool Creation**: Create dedicated resource pools for federation sharing
- **Access Control**: Define which federations can access specific resources
- **Usage Tracking**: Monitor resource consumption across federations
- **Dispute Resolution**: Clear process for handling resource sharing conflicts

## Tips for Effective Resource Management
- **Set Clear Limits**: Prevent overuse by establishing maximum allocations.
- **Review Allocation Periodically**: Adjust allocations based on changing cooperative needs.
- **Encourage Resource Sharing**: Promote shared resource access among members to maximize utility.
