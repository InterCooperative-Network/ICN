# Backend Architecture

The ICN backend handles core blockchain operations, transaction processing, and governance functionalities.

## Modules
1. **Blockchain Module**: Manages the decentralized ledger for recording transactions.
2. **Identity and DID Module**: Handles DID (Decentralized Identifiers) for secure, pseudonymous interactions.
3. **Reputation System**: Tracks and manages reputation scores, influencing governance roles and decision-making.

## Data Flow
- **Transaction Lifecycle**: Transactions are submitted, validated, and recorded in the blockchain, with reputation updates.
- **Reputation Tracking**: User actions affect their reputation score, impacting cooperative influence.
