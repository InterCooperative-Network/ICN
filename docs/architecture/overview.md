# Architecture Overview

The ICN (Inter-Cooperative Network) platform is designed to support decentralized and cooperative governance, resource allocation, and community-based decision-making. This document outlines the overarching architecture that powers the ICN platform.

## Key Components
- **Backend Services**: Provides core functionality, including blockchain operations, identity management, and governance processes.
- **Frontend Interface**: User-facing applications, including the Governance Dashboard and Cooperative Management.
- **Smart Contracts**: Custom cooperative-specific contracts handled by a virtual machine (VM).

## Interaction Flow
1. **User Actions**: Users initiate requests through the frontend.
2. **API Processing**: Requests are routed to backend services via secure API endpoints.
3. **Blockchain and VM**: Transactions are validated, and cooperative actions are processed on-chain.
